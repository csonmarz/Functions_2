● Decomposition: Decomposing a program into
functions can greatly aid program readability, helping 
yield an initially correct program, and
easing future maintenance.

● Modular Development:
Modular development is the process of 
dividing a program into separate modules 
that can be developed and tested separately
and then integrated into a single program.

● Incremental Development: 
Incremental development is a process in 
which a programmer writes and tests a few
statements, then writes and tests a small amount
more (an incremental amount), and so on.

● Function Stub: 
A function stub is a function definition whose 
statements have not yet been written.

● Redundant: 
A function can be defined once, then called 
from multiple places in a program, thus avoiding
redundant statements.
